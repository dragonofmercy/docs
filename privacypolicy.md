Privacy Policy

Your privacy is very important to me, I treat it like i would like mine to be treated. This privacy 
policy document explains when and how personal information may be collected. In any case, only 
non-personally identifiable information is collected, and I never sell, share, trade, or otherwise 
transfer personal information to third parties.

Browser Extensions

My browser extensions do not collect personal information, do not collect your browsing history, and 
do not track your browsing activity. They do not collect data of any sort, and they do not inject ads. 
Reviews that claim otherwise are posted by jealous developers who don't support that some of my browser 
extensions (more particularly Enhancer for YouTubeâ„¢) are featured in the Firefox Add-ons Gallery, 
the Opera Add-ons Gallery, and the Microsoft Store. All my browser extensions are manually reviewed by 
experienced developers before being distributed so if they were not complying with the different guidelines 
and policies (Firefox Add-on Policies, Opera Publishing Guidelines, Google Chrome Web Store Developer 
Agreement and Developer Program Policies for Chrome, Windows App Developer Agreement and Edge Extension Policy 
for Edge) they wouldn't pass reviews and would be rejected.
